# FP Playground

This is a playground which will make you learn functional programming fun again. Each concept has follow up **questions activity** that will make developers stay motivated and engaged.

[Functional programming](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming) is the process of building software by composing **pure functions**, avoiding **shared state**, **mutable data**, and **side-effects**. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast this  with imperative programming where programs are composed of statements which change global state when executed.

#### Why learn FP?

Easy, function code tends to be more concise, more predictable, and easier to test! :sunglasses: Some popular libraries and frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/), [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), [Cycle.js](https://cycle.js.org/) and many more adopt the concepts of FP.

Well, enough said. As chinese proverbs, *Talk doesn't cook rice*. So, let's prepare ourselves to satisfy our cravings.

#### Note
We are using helper functions from [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) in our javascript snippets. But feel free to use other library like [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).
